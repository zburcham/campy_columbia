# Analysis for "Campylobacter infection of young children in Colombia and its impact on the gastrointestinal environment"
Campylobacter infections are a leading cause of bacterial-derived gastroenteritis worldwide with particularly profound impacts on pediatric patients in low and middle income countries. It remains unclear how Campylobacter impacts these hosts, though it is becoming increasingly evident that it is a multifactorial process that depends on the host immune response, the gastrointestinal microbiota, various bacterial factors, and host nutritional status. Since these factors likely vary between adult and pediatric patients in different regions of the world, it is important that studies define these attributes in well characterized clinical cohorts in diverse setting settings. In this study, we analyzed the fecal microbiota and the metabolomic and micronutrient profiles of asymptomatic and symptomatic pediatric patients in Colombia that were either infected or uninfected with Campylobacter during a case-controlled study on acute diarrheal disease.
